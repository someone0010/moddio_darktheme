Dark theme for www.modd.io

**How to use**

Look out for the `style.css` file, and insert it into Modd.io. I recommend using [Stylebot](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylebot/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha) or [Stylish](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish-custom-themes-for/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe). 

__**There are actually 2 .css files. Which one to choose?**__

Which you want. Actually, `style.min.css` is more performant, so I recommend it when you have a low tier PC. It is also recommended generally.

`style.css` is a less performant (takes more to load - 1%) but useful when you want to apply some edits.
